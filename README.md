# ColorSwiper

Hey there! Welcome to ColorSwiper! This is a workshop created by the SMHS Programming Club.

Goals: Create a web version of [Swiper](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/master/workshops/swiper/README.md)

What you will learn: HTML/CSS and jQuery.

As we go by, this README will be updated to the current progress we are in. Hopefully by the end, we would have built an amazing game and workshop for others to use.
